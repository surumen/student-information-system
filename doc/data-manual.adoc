== Entities

=== Base
==== academic_calendar

The academic calendar defines the events that trigger the execution of academic
processes. The period of an event establishes the time interval in which a
functionality is accessible to users. The creation of an event in
`academic_calendar` also creates the same event in the `offer_year_calendar` for
each one of the offers in the same academic year. Modifications in the events
propagates to the respective events in the offers' calendar, except when the
event was changed by the program manager. Deleting an event also deletes all
related events linked to the offers.

==== academic_year
==== attribution
==== learning_unit
==== learning_unit_enrollment
==== learning_unit_year
==== offer
==== offer_enrollment
==== offer_year
==== offer_year_calendar

The calendar of the offers are linked to the academic calendar. Events are
created in the `offer_year_calendar` when an event is created in the
`academic_calendar`. Offers of events can be customized to the needs of the
offer, but when it happens, the field `customized` is set to true and the
record is not updated when `academic_calendar` changes.

==== organization

OSIS is capable of managing multiple institutions in a single installation. All
of them are stored in the table `organization`, including the main organization.
This table also stores all partners of the institution, that includes other
universities, companies, professional schools and any other organization with
who the main institution has partnership with.
